"""Shared rate limiter for the Grid API.

One limiter instance, imported everywhere. Two upgrades over the previous
per-module, in-memory, per-IP limiters:

  1. Keyed by API KEY, not IP. The old per-IP limiter punished everyone
     behind a shared NAT/proxy with a single bucket (and, behind the proxy,
     often saw only the proxy's IP — so one bucket for the whole world).
     Per-key means one user's burst can't 429 everyone else.

  2. Redis-backed storage. In-memory limits were per-uvicorn-worker (so the
     real limit was Nx the configured value) and reset on every restart.
     Shared Redis storage makes the limit real and durable, with an
     in-memory fallback so a Redis blip doesn't take the API down.

Unauthenticated requests fall back to per-IP limiting.

    Bucketing on the raw *presented* key let an attacker rotate garbage keys to
    mint a fresh bucket per request — an unthrottled 401 flood, each doing a DB
    lookup. Requiring a well-formed key before granting a per-key bucket funnels
    junk-key traffic into the per-IP bucket so it's actually throttled. (Residual:
    well-formed-but-fake key rotation still gets per-key buckets — a much narrower
    attack; a per-IP outer ceiling is the follow-up.) Key is hashed so raw
    secrets never become Redis key names.
