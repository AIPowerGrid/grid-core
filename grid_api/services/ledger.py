"""Append-only ledger writes (grid_ledger) — the v2 source of truth.

One event per completed job: who did the work, what it earned (den), and the
content hashes that make the work attestable. The settlement bot Merkle-izes
each epoch's events and anchors the root on-chain; nothing here is ever
updated or deleted.

Hash semantics (v1 of receipts):
  prompt_hash  — sha256 of the canonicalized request payload, computed
                 server-side (we saw the request).
  result_hash  — text: sha256 of the full output, computed server-side.
                 media: worker-reported sha256 of the uploaded bytes (the
                 server never touches media bytes — uploads go direct to R2).
                 Verifiable after the fact by fetching the object.
