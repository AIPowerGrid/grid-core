"""Roll up the den ledger into per-wallet totals for a settlement period.

The on-chain settlement bot calls this to turn the durable grid_ledger
(written per completed job in worker_ws.py via services.ledger) into the
[(wallet, total_den)] list it commits as a Merkle root and pays out.

NOTE: this reads `grid_ledger` (the v2 source of truth, column `wallet`). It
previously read an orphan `grid_den_events` table that nothing ever wrote to,
so every aggregation returned zero rows — i.e. settlement would have paid
nobody. Keep this pointed at the same table services.ledger writes.

Period boundaries are [start, end) UTC half-open intervals so adjacent
periods never double-count a job on the boundary.
